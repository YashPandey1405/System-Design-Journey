# 🔌 WebSockets: Real-Time Communication for the Web

WebSockets enable **bi-directional, persistent communication** between client and server over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP which is stateless and unidirectional (request-response), WebSockets maintain a live connection, perfect for real-time applications like chats, games, dashboards, and collaborative tools.

---

## 🚀 Why Use WebSockets?

- **Instant Updates**: Push data from server to client in real-time
- **Efficient**: No need to poll the server again and again (unlike HTTP polling)
- **Bidirectional**: Both client and server can initiate communication
- **Low Latency**: Ideal for real-time experiences like multiplayer games or live trading platforms

---

## 🛠 How Do WebSockets Work?

WebSockets work via an **initial HTTP handshake**, which then upgrades the connection to a WebSocket protocol (`ws://` or `wss://`).

### 🎯 Why We Still Need an HTTP Port?

- ExpressJS (or any backend framework) initially listens on an **HTTP port** (like `3000`) to handle requests
- WebSocket (e.g., with Socket.IO) uses the **same port** to upgrade the connection from HTTP → WebSocket
- This keeps things seamless: static files, API routes, and WebSocket connections can all work on the same server instance

## 🔄 Redis Pub/Sub for Scaling WebSockets

In real-world systems, you often scale horizontally using multiple Node.js instances. This introduces a problem: each instance has its own memory and connected sockets — **clients connected to Server A won’t receive events emitted by Server B**.

### ✅ Solution: Redis Pub/Sub Adapter

Redis acts as a **message broker** between all Socket.IO server instances:

1. Instance A emits an event
2. Redis publishes it
3. Instance B/C/D receives it and forwards to their clients

![Redis Pub-Sub Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*S6NWPwA7NHZLlOpgkKvOmA.png)

### 📦 Packages Required:

```bash
npm install socket.io socket.io-redis
```

### 🔌 Basic Redis Pub/Sub Setup

```js
const { createServer } = require("http");
const { Server } = require("socket.io");
const Redis = require("ioredis");
const redisAdapter = require("@socket.io/redis-adapter");

const httpServer = createServer();
const io = new Server(httpServer);

const pubClient = new Redis();
const subClient = pubClient.duplicate();
io.adapter(redisAdapter(pubClient, subClient));

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("Client connected", socket.id);

  socket.on("chat", (msg) => {
    console.log("Message Received:", msg);
    io.emit("chat", msg); // Broadcast to all connected clients
  });
});

httpServer.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

## 📡 Basic Flow of WebSocket Communication

### 🔁 Client Side (Browser)

```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  const socket = io();

  // Send message to server
  socket.emit("chat", "Hello Server!");

  // Receive message from server
  socket.on("chat", (msg) => {
    console.log("Message from server:", msg);
  });
</script>
```

### 🧠 Server Side (Node.js + Express)

```js
const express = require("express");
const http = require("http");
const { Server } = require("socket.io");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("A user connected");

  socket.on("chat", (msg) => {
    console.log("Received message:", msg);
    io.emit("chat", msg);
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server listening on port 3000"));
```

## 🧱 Summary

- WebSockets maintain persistent two-way communication
- Socket.IO builds on WebSocket with fallbacks and broadcast features
- Redis enables horizontal scaling using the Pub/Sub pattern
- Combine with JWT and Redis sessions for secure, distributed real-time apps

> WebSockets + Redis = Real-time power with distributed scalability. Ideal for the modern web.
