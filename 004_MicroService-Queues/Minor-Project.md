# 🧵 BullMQ-QueueMaster

A production-grade mini-project that demonstrates **job queue management using BullMQ** with **Redis** as the backend store.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Implements a **robust job queue system** using BullMQ.
- Processes background jobs efficiently with **Redis** as the message broker.
- Simulates task producers and consumers for real-world scenarios like image processing, email queues, etc.
- Tracks job status: `waiting`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`.

## 📦 Features

- Built with **Node.js**, **BullMQ**, and **Redis**.
- Job creation via REST API (`/add-job`).
- Real-time logging of job progress and result.
- Queue monitoring through BullMQ's architecture.
