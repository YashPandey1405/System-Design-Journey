# ⚙️ SocketScaler-Redis

A mini-system design project that demonstrates **horizontal WebSocket scaling** using **Redis (Valkey) Pub/Sub**.

## 🧩 What It Does

- Synchronizes 100 checkboxes in real-time across multiple server instances or ports.
- Uses **Redis as a message broker** to broadcast updates between WebSocket servers.
- Supports multi-port horizontal scaling (e.g., ports 8000–8003) to simulate load balancing.
- Ideal for understanding real-world **Pub/Sub**, **state sync**, and **scalable socket architecture**.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Node.js + WebSocket
- Redis (Valkey)
- Socket.io
