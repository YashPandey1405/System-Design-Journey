# ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions CI/CD + Jest Testing

A mini project to **demonstrate CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub Actions**, along with **automated unit testing** using **Jest** and **Supertest** in a Node.js Express app.

---

## üìö What Are CI/CD Pipelines?

**CI/CD** stands for:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically runs tests when code is pushed, ensuring each commit doesn‚Äôt break existing functionality.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys the app when tests pass, making the release process faster and more reliable.

## üß∞ What Are GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a built-in automation tool provided by GitHub that helps in:

- Creating custom workflows like testing, linting, and deployment.
- Triggering jobs on events like `push`, `pull_request`, or `merge`.
- Ensuring automated checks on every commit.

## üß™ Unit Testing with Jest & Supertest

- **Jest** is a JavaScript testing framework to run unit tests.
- **Supertest** is used for **HTTP assertions** ‚Äî it helps you test your Express routes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Mini Project Overview

- Built a Node.js Express server.
- Wrote unit tests for routes using Jest & Supertest.
